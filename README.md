# 2D RPG

This project began as a way to build Unity 2D development skills. By the end, there was so much more that I wanted to add. The final vision was a cross between "The Legend of Zelda" and "The Binding of Isaac."
I integrated Jira into my workflow to plan and track the features I wanted to add. I also integrated Jira with SourceTree, which is why you will notice Jira keys at the start of the most recent code commits. 
The Jira project was titled "Zeldalike," hence the ZEL key. 

In the end, a shiny new project took my attention away from this one. I keep this project in the back of my mind as one to return to in the future.
